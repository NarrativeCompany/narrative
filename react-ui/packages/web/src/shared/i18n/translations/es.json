  "nicheExplainerMessages.nicheContentSubmissionParagraphOne": "Once you’ve created your article, photo, or other content, you can choose to “tag” it to up to 3 Niches. It's beneficial to link your content to Niches because you expand the reach of your content to people who are interested in those subjects. For example, if you’ve written an article about a rescued sea turtle release, you might submit it to the “Marine Biology,” “Sea Turtles,” and “Beach” Niches. Additionally, as the content creator, you won’t get paid your share of the rewards for any content that isn’t associated with at least one Niche.",

  "nicheExplainerMessages.nicheOriginSectionTitle": "Where do {titleHighlight} come from?",
  "nicheExplainerMessages.nicheOwnershipParagraphOne": "With Narrative, you can own your Niche and build a community around it. Niche owners are like club promoters. They promote and increase the popularity of the Niche, and then earn rewards as it becomes more popular. In the future, you will also be able to put your Niche back up for auction and retain 90% of the profits from the re-sale.",
  "nicheExplainerMessages.nicheOwnershipParagraphTwo": "Another way to think about Niche ownership is like web domain names.
