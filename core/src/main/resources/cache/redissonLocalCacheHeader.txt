# Redisson localCacheOptions:
#
#   reconnectionStrategy:
#       NONE          - No reconnect handling
#       CLEAR         - Clear local cache if map instance has been disconnected for a while
#       LOAD          - Store invalidated entry hash in invalidation log for 10 minutes. Cache keys
#                       for stored invalidated entry hashes will be removed if LocalCachedMap instance
#                       has been disconnected less than 10 minutes or whole cache will be cleaned otherwise.
#
#   syncStrategy:
#       NONE          - No synchronizations on map changes.
#       INVALIDATE    - Invalidate cache entry across all LocalCachedMap instances on map entry
#                       change. Broadcasts map entry hash (16 bytes) to all instances.
#       UPDATE        - Update cache entry across all LocalCachedMap instances on map entry change.
#                       Broadcasts full map entry state (Key and Value objects) to all instances.
#   evictionPolicy:
#       NONE          - Cache without eviction.
#       LRU           - Least Recently Used cache.
#       LFU           - Least Frequently Used cache.
#       SOFT          - Cache with Soft Reference used for values. All references will be collected by GC
#       WEAK          - Cache with Weak Reference used for values. All references will be collected by GC
#
#   writeMode:
#       WRITE_BEHIND  - In write behind mode all data written in map object also written using MapWriter
#                       in asynchronous mode
#       WRITE_THROUGH - In write through mode all write operations for map object are
#                       synchronized with MapWriter write operations.  If MapWriter
#                       throws an error then it will be re-thrown to Map operation caller.
